Reinforcement Learning Maze Solver

Overview
This project implements a maze-solving algorithm using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. The RL algorithm, based on SARSA, is applied to an environment provided by the OpenAI Gym library. The goal is to train an intelligent agent to navigate through a maze and reach a predefined target.

Introduction
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm that enables autonomous agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies in dynamic environments. In this project, we utilize the SARSA algorithm to teach an agent to navigate a maze within the OpenAI Gym framework.

For a detailed explanation of the project, refer to the project report.

Usage
To use the maze-solving RL algorithm, follow these steps:

Environment Setup:

Install the required dependencies using:
bash
Copy code
python setup.py install
Code Execution:

Open the provided code file and customize hyperparameters if needed.
Run the Code:

Execute the code, and observe the agent's learning progress.
Post-Learning Evaluation:

After learning, the agent runs for an additional 10,000 steps, and the total wins are printed.
Review Output:

Analyze the printed output to assess the agent's performance.
Environment Closure:

The environment is closed automatically, concluding the program.
Environment Setup
To set up the environment, download the package from this link and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python setup.py install
For more details, refer to the installation guide.
